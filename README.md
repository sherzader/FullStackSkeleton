This is a skeleton for a full-stack web app in Node, with Webpack, Babel, Jest configured.

1. start webpack:
   `npm run webpack`

2. start the server:
   `npm run server`

3. run the tests:
   `npm test`

Webpack and the server will watch for changes, no need to restart them unless you change their configurations.
