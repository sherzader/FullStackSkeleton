Purpose
To determine a person’s web development strengths that can be applied to the core web team’s work.

Skills Tested

1. Communication - “what is the goal of this problem? what are the limits? my limits? none?”
2. Planning - “should I think about my attack, or just chuck the sword into the gears?”
3. Writing code - “let’s name this function ‘functionA’, that won’t hurt me later”
4. Refactoring code - this will be a sub-problem in order to get a feature to work
5. Tests - “can I glean feature information from tests? can I fix tests if I break functionality?”
6. JavaScript - “can I write this? do I know about es6?”
7. Code Editor - “do I have it configured or am I apathetic about time?”
8. Debugging - “do I know how to debug in the browser? how cozy am I with browser dev tools”

Problem Skeleton
There will be a full-stack app in Node to keep it to one language.
All the functionality to get the app serving on localhost will exist, so a user doesn’t need to know Node or a backend framework because it’s not applicable to our team’s projects and you have to look at the API docs a lot to write it. Boring, moving on.
The frontend will be configured with helpful packages. There will be tests written for the finished solution and are a helpful path to a strong solution, if noticed.

Problem
Write the game Snake. It will be a full-stack web app that has the capabilities of playing the game and saving the game’s state.
